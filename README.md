Hi，
I'm Shuhang2022. I'm good at latex, R, and python. I majored in economics and mathematics, and minor in statistics. I am very interested in Python, which is a simple and creative language.
I love hiking, enjoy thinking alone, and I am interested in mathematical models and economic problems. I am an amateur violinist and I enjoy a music style called Vaporwave pretty much. Sometimes I play soccer and mostly I exercise in the gym.
I will insist on improving my GitHub page.......
I hope you have a good day!
